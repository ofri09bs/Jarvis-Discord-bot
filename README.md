# Jarvis - Discord Bot

Welcome to Jarvis, a sophisticated, personality-driven Discord bot that emulates **'Jarvis'** from Iron Man.

## üåü Description

This bot uses Google Gemini to hold witty, in-character conversations. It's designed to be loyal to its creator, address users as 'Sir', and provide short, precise answers.

The bot remembers your conversation history on a **per-channel basis** and will only respond when triggered directly.

## üöÄ Features

* **Advanced AI Personality:** Powered by Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`) with a detailed system instruction to act exactly like Jarvis.
* **Channel-Specific Memory:** Jarvis remembers the context of your conversation in *each channel* separately.
* **Multiple Triggers:** You can talk to Jarvis by:
    1.  Mentioning him (`@Jarvis`)
    2.  Starting your message with his name (`jarvis ...`)
    3.  Replying to one of his messages.
* **Creator Recognition:** The bot is hard-coded to recognize its owner via the `BOT_OWNER_ID` and respond with special loyalty and permissions.
* **Moderation Tools:** Includes a native `timeout` command for server moderation.
* **Fun Commands:** Includes several 'fun' commands like `activate`, `leak`, and `ban_this_guy`.
* **Uptime Ready:** Includes a built-in Flask web server, making it easy to deploy on services like Replit that require a web server to stay alive.
